Didnt watch the whole series of this Project by now (only the last part) and had to stumble my way true to find a way to style it, without access to an firebase storage.

I just changed the state-management a little bit in App.js.

Every style used is inside of a variable (styled-component) near the start of the file.

Only Globalstyling is in ../components/styles_and_animations.

Wanted to add more and make it cleaner (only styled the create-page and landing page by now), but wasnt sure if it is conflicting with
changes made by a existing firebase storage.. But still wanted to add something to the project,
even if only a color idea.

Also if there is a conflict because of not sign in verification, you can see inside of public
folder how it looks like in my environment + a example dashboard i made for myself (all very basic but if needed i can put more time in it.)
